A text summarizer is a tool that wraps up a text to a specified short length. It condenses a long article
to main points. The need for text summarizers are increasing day by day, because of time constraints. People
are looking for shortcut methods to learn ideas in lesser time. Even text summarizers are helping them to
decide whether a book, a research paper, or an article is worth reading or not.
